Please modify your README.md:
  git clone --recursive git@github.com:mteresa0/pacs-challenge01.git

Please remove the obj folder if you don't use it in the Makefile.
Note that you are not createing any obj files since you are not linking. Check if this is what you wanted to do, or 
if you wanted to have all the obj files inside the obj folder :)

Code Design:
  - If you want, you can add a bin folder and let the makefile generate the binary there
  - The code should have been commented a bit more, however code is very readable and simple. 
  - Although I really like the old fashioned hard coded functions, maybe a muParser usage would have been better.


The code is very clean, clear and definitely well written.
